# MaxLength Revealer

A handy Firefox extension to visually indicate the length of the password field before you paste something into it. I use a password manager to keep track of all my 128-character passwords, and sometimes when signing up for new websites, they've been cut off, locking me out of the account.

You can download it from the Firefox Addons page [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/maxlength-revealer/).

I learned after I published that there's a config option to apply to frames as well, so I might update it in the future. It works for now, though.
